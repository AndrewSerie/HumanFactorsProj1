## Wireframe
- Only 1 person can work on it at a time. There is no collaboration mode so once you make changes, push it to master so others can work on it
##Py Proj
- In order to run put all the files wherever your python executeable is in a folder named UIProj
- Next I usually run it by going to the cmd and navigating into the location where the python.exe is and enter in the file path to   the MainView.py.. for instance mine is cd C:\Users\Michael\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32 -> python.exe C:\Users\Michael\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\UIProj\MainView.py
